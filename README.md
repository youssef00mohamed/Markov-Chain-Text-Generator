# Markov Chain Text Generation from Stand-Up Comedy Transcripts

This repository contains Python scripts to preprocess stand-up comedy transcripts and generate new sentences using Markov chains.

## Overview

The project is designed to achieve the following:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize stand-up comedy transcripts.
2. **Markov Chain Modeling**: Build a Markov chain model from the preprocessed text.
3. **Text Generation**: Generate new sentences based on the Markov chain model.

## Results

The generated sentences exhibit stylistic patterns similar to the original stand-up comedy routines. Example output:

"I said to my wife, 'Why don't you tell your friends, you know, you don't have a great comedian, you have a man who loves you?'"

## Usage

To run the Markov chain text generation process, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2.**Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3.**Run the script :**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Markov Chain.ipynb
   ```

4.**View Results**

  - After executing the notebook, scroll through the notebook to view the generated text.
  - The generated sentences will be displayed inline with the code cells where they are generated.
